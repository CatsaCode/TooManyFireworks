# Too Many Fireworks

Don't think there's enough fireworks? This mod adds a variety of settings that can make fireworks powerful enough to explode the game itself!

## Current Options

- Min / max frequency
- Rainbow color
- Specific color
- Brightness
- Min / max size
- Number of sparks
- Gravity
- Spawn range
- Show on level clear

## Known Bugs

- Color will flicker when a slider is moved with rainbow color on
- Light rays will flicker when a size slider is moved
- Sounds donâ€™t quiet down with song selection and other menus
- Sound is tied to SFX volume. If fireworks are silent, check to see if this is zero

## Future Ideas

- Show in menu
- Show in level select
- Show on high score
- Show on clear
- Show on fail
- Show on rank
- Collisions
- Bounce strength / dampen
- Color over time
- Spark size
- Turbulence
- Minimum spark speed multiplier
- Different type of firework for each condition
- Color palettes
- Mute sounds / Sound probability
- Change random sound pitch
- Change audio clips
- Custom sprite
- Smooth disable
- Cheerleading
- Duration
- Custom shapes
- Quick preset buttons

Or, I might create a new mod that allows customizability to the whole Unity Particle System for anything and everything!
